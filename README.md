# ARoute--An-Augmented-Reality-Based-Indoor-Navigation-App

Introduction

ARoute, is an Augmented Reality based indoor navigation, which provides an organization to increase their services, i.e. by providing an indoor navigation of their users. It will provide the user to act as an organization, in order to scan an area, and implement indoor navigation on it or to use indoor navigation of the requested area. The app will build the indoor map using ARKIT and will show the shortest route from source to destination using Augmented Reality objects.
Moreover, the app will provide features such as letting the user know if their friends are in close vicinity to them, displaying the significance of the selected areas in navigated pathway etc. which will further enhance the usability of the app, help to make user experience even better. 

Vision

The vision of ARoute is to become an essential day to day application for the user, which will guide them through an unknown environment and provide various in built features to further support them at every step of the way. The app will be responsive to the customer’s needs and wants, and will provide accurate and shortest route from their source to their requested destination with the help of augmented reality to futurize the navigated pathway.

Objectives:

•	To scan the entire targeted location using ARKIT and create a map for the scanned area.
•	To create a weighted graph from the map we have stored using ARKIT.
•	To calculate the shortest path between source and destination using A* algorithm.
•	To augment the shortest path, by arrowheads, onto the screen in real-time.

Key High Level Goal:  

•	ARoute will scan the entire targeted environment.
•	ARoute will assign marker points in the scanned environment to identify a significant location.
•	ARoute will convert the scanned environment mapping into a weighted graph.
•	ARoute will store the graph with the nametags of the targeted location.
•	ARoute will request the user to enter their destination via text command, speech command or a list of available destinations in the targeted spot.
•	If the requested location is already placed in the database, the ARoute will show him the available map generated using ARKIT technology.
•	If the requested location isn't available in the database, the user can scan the entire environment, using ARoute, in order to facilitate other people who may come to that     location and will require an indoor navigation system.
